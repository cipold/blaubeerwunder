# blaubeerwunder

This web app is a birthday present for my wife who lovingly prepares this cake recipe called "Blaubeerwunder" for the
birthdays of our kids.

It is meant as an overkill solution to help adapt the original recipe for the pans that are going to be used and give
step-by-step instructions including the correct amount of ingredients.

After building the frontend-only web app it can be deployed on a static web server. A live version is hosted
here: https://blaubeerwunder.cipold.de
